# React GoogleBooks Reading List

## Description

  [Deployed Application](https://react-googlebooks-reading-list.herokuapp.com/)
   
   This is a clean and simple React application to keep a personal reading list. It has a built-in GoogleBooks search to provide recommendations based on any keyword provided. Unfortunately, even though a user has a lot of flexibility with their search keyword, the results list is limited to a maximum of 10. So, even if looking for a specific book, more than one keyword might be necessary to actually return the desired result. After searching, a user can choose to save the book, view books on GoogleBooks, and delete from the saved book list. At this time, this application may only be used by one user at a time as there is no user data and books are not saved by any user id.
